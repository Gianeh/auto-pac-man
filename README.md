# Auto-Pac-Man â€“ Development Branch

**Disclaimer:**  
This branch contains early development and experiments only. The code here represents initial efforts and may be unstable or incomplete.

## Overview

This repository explores various approaches to solving Pac-Man through dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. The main branch collects early experiments, including:
- **Pygame Implementation:** A basic version of Pac-Man built with Pygame.
- **Initial DP & RL Solutions:** Early implementations of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning frameworks.

## Branches

For stable implementations, please refer to the following branches:
- **dp:** Project centered on dynamic programming.
- **rl:** Q-Learning solution.
- **neural_rl:** Deep Q-Learning solutions.

## Disclaimer
- **Collaboration:** This project is a collaborative academic effort. Contributions from team members have shaped this exploratory work.
